<div class="card-beige">
  <H2>ESSEC RMX:</H2>
  <img src="images/rmx-logo.png" height="30%" width="30%" alt="RMX logo" class="img-centered">
    <li>What is this association ?</li>
  <p>Rmx is an association that promotes <strong>electronic culture </strong>and mixing in the student environment. Indeed, we mix not only for ESSEC but also for other schools especially during inter-school events such as the <strong>Derby des Parisiennes</strong>.
	  <li>How do we learn how to mix ?</li>
  <p>The RMX board associates a <strong>"godparent"</strong>to each new recruit to teach them how to mix. Very quickly, we are in contact with the turntables and choose to place our sounds. Unfortunately with the coronavirus, this integration and learning could not be fully achieved.</p>
